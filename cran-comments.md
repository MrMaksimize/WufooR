## This is a submission
Dear CRAN Maintainers,

I have updated my package inline with Mr. Ripley (email 28th of Aug. 2015) comments about fedora checks. 
This package has been tested on fedora, ubuntu and windows 8; always with the latest release of R. 

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There were 1 NOTE:

* No repository set, so cyclic dependency check skipped

## Downstream dependencies
There are no downstream dependencies.
