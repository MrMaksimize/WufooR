\description{
Methods for setting your Wufoo Name & API Key, permanently. For both of them visit your
profile. For API Key go to \code{https://yourName.wufoo.com/api/code/1/}
}
\note{
Wufoo currently restricts your API usage to 5000 requests per day.

It is necessary to use the \code{auth_name} from the *Account Tab* in the settings of WuFoo.
Not from the *Users Tab*. Therefore the name is in a usual format of \code{https://yourName.wufoo.com}
}
\examples{
options(Wufoo_Name = "johnmalc", Wufoo_API = "F1QH-Q64B-BSBI-JASJ")

}
